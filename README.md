# webapi-clean-architecture
we want our core of the system should not be changed while we should have flexibilities to change the UI and database

# Important one when starting a Clean Architecture project!
Start from the inside out — begin with the Domain Layer, then Application, then Infrastructure, and finally the Web API.

**This follows the dependency rule:**
Inner layers shouldn’t depend on outer layers, but outer layers can depend on inner layers.

**Domain Layer (Core Business Logic)**
- This is your most stable, long-lasting code. Start here.
- Define your Entities (e.g., Order, OrderItem)
- Possibly define Value Objects
- Define Domain Events or Business Rules if needed

[Think of this as your business language — pure logic, no frameworks.]

**Application Layer**
- Now add the use cases and interfaces that interact with the domain.
- Define Interfaces (e.g., IOrderService, IOrderRepository)
- Add DTOs, Commands/Queries, and Services
- Add logic like CreateOrderAsync

[This is where you define what your app does, but not how.]

**Infrastructure Layer**
- Now implement the interfaces from Application.
- Implement OrderRepository using EF Core
- Create AppDbContext
- Configure entity mappings
- Hook up external services (like email, file storage, etc.)

[Infrastructure is where the rubber meets the road — DB, APIs, etc.]

**Web API Layer**
- Finally, create the API that exposes your Application services.
- Create Controllers
- Handle model binding and validation
- Wire up DI and app settings
- Register DbContext, Services, and Repositories

[This is just a delivery mechanism — no business logic here.]
